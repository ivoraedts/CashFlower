# CashFlower
I plan to build an application that gives more insight in someone’s personal cashflow. The data must come from exports from existing banking software. For example transaction exports from Rabobank and ABN Amrobank. For your insight it helps to categorize some transactions and contra accounts. Also some transactions should be ignored (for instance transactions with your own saving accounts as a contra party). Some transactions should be altered. (imagine: 1 - if you pay back money that You borrowed last year, the calculation date should be last year; imagine: 2 – if you get back money from taxes, because you payed too much last year, the calculation date should be last year and should even be distributed over the whole year) So visualizing and editing will be interesting challenges.
